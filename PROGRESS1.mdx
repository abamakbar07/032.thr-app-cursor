title: "Family Gacha THR App - UI Components Progress"

## I've created several key UI components for the Family Gacha THR App based on the `PROGRESS.mdx` file. Here's what I've implemented:

### Core UI Components
- **Button**: A reusable button component with variants, sizes, and loading states
- **Card**: A flexible card component with header, content, and footer sections
- **Input**: A form input component with label, helper text, and error states

### Layout Components
- **Navbar**: A responsive navigation bar with mobile menu support
- **DashboardLayout**: A layout component for admin interfaces with sidebar navigation

### Game-Specific Components
- **GachaWheel**: An animated wheel component for the gacha spin mechanism
- **GameRoomCard**: A card component for displaying game room information
- **QuestionForm**: A form component for adding and editing trivia questions

These components provide a solid foundation for building the user interface. The next steps would be to:

- Create the **authentication pages** (signin and signup)
- Implement the **admin dashboard pages**
- Build the **game interface** for participants
- Add the **trivia game interface**
- Create the **reward display components**

Would you like me to continue with implementing any of these next steps?
