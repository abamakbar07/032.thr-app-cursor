- Installed necessary dependencies

### Database Models
- **User** model with `admin` and `cousin` roles
- **GameRoom** model for creating game rooms with customizable reward tiers
- **Question** model for trivia questions
- **ThrSpin** model to track gacha spins and rewards
- **SpinToken** model for earned tokens
- **CousinEntry** model for participant registration

### Authentication
