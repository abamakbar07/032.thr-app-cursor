## Implementation Summary

I've completed the core logic implementation for the Family Gacha THR application. Here's what I've added or modified:

### Server Actions (`src/lib/actions.ts`)
- **Room Statistics Actions:**
  - `getRoomStatistics`: Fetch comprehensive room data including participant counts, question completion stats, and reward distribution.
  - `getQuestionStatistics`: Detailed question completion tracking.
  - `getParticipantStats`: Track individual participant performance.
  - `getRewardDistribution`: Display reward tier distribution and history.
- **Code Improvements:**
  - Fixed TypeScript issues throughout the codebase to ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors.

### Admin Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/rooms/[roomId]/page.tsx`)
- **Created a comprehensive admin room statistics page with:**
  - Overview dashboard showing key metrics.
  - Question status listing with completion tracking.
  - Participant performance tracking.
  - Reward distribution statistics.
- **The admin dashboard implements a tab-based interface that allows administrators to:**
  - Monitor overall game progress.
  - Track which questions have been solved and by whom.
  - View participant engagement metrics.
  - Monitor reward distribution and remaining inventory.

### Player Game Room (`src/app/game/[roomId]/page.tsx`)
- **Implemented a complete player experience with:**
  - Entry validation and registration.
  - Question answering interface with difficulty indication.
  - Token earning mechanism through correct answers.
  - Gacha wheel for claiming THR rewards.
  - Reward history tracking.
- **The player interface supports:**
  - First-time registration flow.
  - Returning player authentication.
  - Question answering with immediate feedback.
  - Reward claiming with animations and celebratory effects.

### Key Features Implemented
- **Room Management:**
  - Statistical tracking for admins.
  - Participant management.
- **User Participation:**
  - QR code entry system.

  - Question answering interface.
- **Question-Solving Tracking:**
