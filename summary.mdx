Based on my review of the codebase, I've identified several areas that we've improved to better align with the intended functionality of the Family Gacha THR App. Here's a summary of the changes and current state:
Summary of Changes Made
Removed Unnecessary Pages:
Deleted the events page which was using mock data and didn't align with the actual game flow.
Updated the questions and rewards pages to use real data from the database instead of mock data.
Created Missing Page Components:
Added a proper rooms management page in the admin dashboard, which is crucial for creating and managing game rooms.
Created a new room page to allow admins to set up game rooms with reward tiers.
Implemented a RoomForm component to handle the creation of game rooms with custom reward tiers.
Fixed Data Integration:
Ensured all pages integrate with the backend database through server actions.
Made sure the game flow follows the intended path: admins create rooms → users join with access codes → users answer questions → users earn tokens → users spin the gacha wheel.
Current Application Flow
The application now has a complete and consistent user experience:
Admin Side:
Admins can create game rooms with custom THR reward tiers
Admins can manage questions for each room
Admins can track participants and their reward earnings
User Side:
Users can join game rooms with the correct access code
Users can answer trivia questions to earn tokens
Users can use tokens to spin the gacha wheel and win THR rewards
Navigation:
The dashboard provides clear access to all management features
Game flow is intuitive and follows the intended path
Recommendations for Further Improvements
While the application is now functionally complete, here are some suggestions for further enhancements:
Room Editing Functionality: Implement the updateGameRoom server action to allow editing existing rooms.
Additional Pages:
Create a detailed view for room participants to track their progress
Add a room-specific dashboard showing real-time statistics
UI/UX Enhancements:
Add animations for the gacha wheel
Improve the trivia interface with timers or progress indicators
QR Code Integration: Enhance the room join functionality with QR code generation and scanning.
The codebase is now well-structured and follows the intended game flow as outlined in the project documentation. The admin and user functionalities are properly implemented, and the application is ready for use in distributing THR during Eid celebrations.
