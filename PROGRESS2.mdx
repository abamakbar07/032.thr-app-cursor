## I've enhanced the client-side functionalities of your Family Gacha THR App to make it more robust and provide a better user experience. Here's what I've created and improved:

### Authentication and State Management
- **Authentication Hook**: Created a `useAuth` hook that manages authentication state, including sign-in, sign-out, and user data persistence.
- **Game Context Provider**: Built a `useGameContext` hook and provider to manage game state, token counts, and spin history with real-time updates.

### Client-Side Components
- **Token Display Component**: Created a real-time token display that updates automatically and polls for changes.
- **Client Gacha Page**: Built a client-side gacha wheel component that handles animations and updates the state after spins.
- **Client Trivia Page**: Developed a responsive trivia component that provides immediate feedback and transitions between questions without full page reloads.
- **Cousin Entry Validator**: Enhanced the validation component for secure entry, with proper error handling and user feedback.

### Server-to-Client Integration
- **Server Actions with Client Feedback**: Improved the server actions to return appropriate responses for client-side processing.
- **Hybrid Rendering Approach**: Implemented a pattern where server components fetch initial data and client components handle interaction and updates.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Added polling and refresh mechanisms to ensure users see the most current data.

### User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users now receive immediate feedback when answering questions or spinning the wheel.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added transitions between different states of the game to create a more fluid experience.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the app with clear error messages.

These enhancements make the app more responsive, provide better feedback to users, and ensure that data remains up-to-date without requiring full page reloads. The authentication and game state contexts provide a solid foundation for further development of client-side features.
